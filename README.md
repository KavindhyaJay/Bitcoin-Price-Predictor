My very first Machine Learning project!

I built a Bitcoin Price Prediction App that predicts future BTC prices and visualizes historical trends. ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°

Key Highlights:

Technologies & Tools : Python, Streamlit, Plotly, yfinance, Pandas, NumPy

Algorithm : LSTM for time series forecasting

Features:

	â€¢ Fetches live BTC data

	â€¢ Displays current, max, and min BTC prices

	â€¢ Predicts and visualizes future Bitcoin prices

	â€¢ Compares predicted vs actual prices with interactive charts

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in time series forecasting, deep learning, data preprocessing, and interactive web deployment.

ðŸ’¡ Super excited to continue exploring the world of Machine Learning and Data Science!
